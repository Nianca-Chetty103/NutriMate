# NutriMate 🥗
A UX/UI design I created with figma. Just an app that can help and suggest to users how to diet a little bit healthier or at least making better choices when it comes to making healthy eating choices.

## What I learnt
- one to get a better understanding of how the frontend design works in using figma.
- how things are formatted and built for encouraging user engagement.
- started with low-fidelity prototype, now busy the building a better high fidelity project using the lower fidelity prototype.

## Features
- navigate through diet app
- diet plan
- find meals for everyone according to restricting diets
- share and save meals you want to try.
- join a community of tips and advice.

## How does it help the community
- help people make better choices when it comes to dieting and healthier eating.
- encourages collaboration with sharing of receipes and advice
- educates them on being concious on healtier alternates
- shows quick and convienient meals to prep and cook
