# NutriMate 🥗
A UX/UI design I created with figma.

# Why I Built this 
- one to get a better understanding of how the frontend design works in using figma.
- how things are formatted and built for the user for convenience.
- started with low-fidelity prototype, now busy the building a better high fidelity project using the lower fidelity prototype.
