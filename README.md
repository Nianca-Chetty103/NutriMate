# NutriMate 🥗
A UX/UI design I created with figma.

## What I learnt
- one to get a better understanding of how the frontend design works in using figma.
- how things are formatted and built for the user for convenience.
- started with low-fidelity prototype, now busy the building a better high fidelity project using the lower fidelity prototype.

## Features
- navigate through diet app
- diet plan
- find meals for everyone according to restricting diets

## How does it help the community
- help people make better chioces when coming to diets and healthier eating.
- encourages collaboration with sharing of receipes and advice
